# ‚ö° Lightning

**Lightning** is a lightweight, cross-platform peer-to-peer (P2P) file transfer tool built with **Go**, **WebRTC**, and **WebSocket**. It enables **secure, fast, and direct file transfers** between devices without relying on intermediate servers.

## üì¶ Version

Current version: **v0.0.1**

---

## ‚ú® Features

- ‚ôæÔ∏è **No File Size Limit**  
- ü§ñ **No Registration Required**  
- üîí **End-to-End Encrypted Transfer**  
- üíª **Frontend / Backend Decoupled Architecture**  
- üîÑ **Auto-Update Support**  
- üìÅ **Folder Compression + Streaming Transfer**  
- üß† **File or Folder Auto Detection**  
- ü™µ **Structured Logging (zap, debug level)**  

---

## üîß How It Works

### üñ•Ô∏è Frontend

- Displays file/folder transfer progress  
- Communicates with backend over WebSocket  
- Provides connection link to receiver

### üß† Backend (written in Go)

- Handles file/folder transmission  
- Compresses folders on the fly  
- Uses WebRTC + WebSocket for peer connection  
- Applies AES encryption for secure data  
- Detects and processes file vs folder  
- Logs every step using `zap` at debug level

## üîÅ File Transfer Flow

1. **Right-click** a file/folder and choose to open with Lightning
2. Lightning client starts and **retrieves path**
3. Connects to signaling server to **create room ID** and generates a **share link**
4. Receiver opens the share link to connect
5. Once connected:
    - If path is a **file** ‚Üí Directly transferred via WebRTC  
    - If it's a **folder** ‚Üí Folder is compressed on-the-fly and streamed
6. After transfer completes ‚Üí App exits automatically

## üöÄ Getting Started

Coming soon...

> Support for right-click integration, standalone `.exe` launcher, and auto-update logic will be documented soon.
